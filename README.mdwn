Fortune HTTP
=============

Serves fortune files via http.
Both an html and a json view available. What else?

Details
--------

This does not run the `fortune-mod` executable; instead, it reimplements
the strfile command parsing the file and caching it.

How To
=======

* `mkdir fortunedbs`
* put your favourite fortunes in that directory; note that filenames should be
* alphanumeric if you want to change some configuration, create a
  `custom_config.py` file and add what you want there.
* `python2 serve.py` will justwork(tm); but if you have custom configuration,
  run `python2 serve.py custom_config.py`

Dependencies
------------

Just plain virtualenv + `requirements.txt`. But in the end, the only requirement
is `flask`.

Configuration
--------------

* `FORTUNEPATH` defaults to `fortunedbs`
* `DEFAULT_FORTUNE`; setting this will make the webserver respond to `/`
  requests
* all flask config variables: `DEBUG`, whatever...
